Codec operations
- Work to find increased orthogonality of methods
- Flowtiles (?)
- "Compiled" remap
- Direct decoding/encoding
- Write schema after new spec

Error handling
- Need a pattern to implement errors intended to notify users
- Better error handling for serializers

General Refactors
- Give Codecs to SequentialArranger instead of CodecFactory; ensures compatible element sizing; better use of codec information in general

Palette
- Start adding unit tests
- Use lambdas/delegate for color converters
- Isolate specific palette implementations? Move to ImageMagitek.Color

Project
- Implement renaming/moving logic

Low priority
- Implement BitStream.WriteBits

Bugs
- ArrangerExtensions to move rows/pages erroneously assume each element's storage size is the same
