# TileShop and ImageMagitek
TileShop is a WPF application for Windows that implements ImageMagitek and allows end-users to manage specialized graphics in a modern GUI environment. ImageMagitek is a work-in-progress .NET library written in C# to view, edit, and organize common and complex retro videogame system graphics. Emphasis is given to the features most valuable to the common, cumbersome tasks when encountering graphics embedded within binaries without any distinguishable headers or identifiers. Advanced editing features can be performed in other image editors that operate on standard PNG formats after exporting.

See the [releases page](https://github.com/stevemonaco/ImageMagitek/releases) to download and the [wiki](https://github.com/stevemonaco/ImageMagitek/wiki) for details.
