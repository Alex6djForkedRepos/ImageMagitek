Codec operations
- Work to find increased orthogonality of methods
- Flowtiles (?)
- "Compiled" remap
- Direct decoding/encoding
- Write schema after new spec
- Separate into encoding and decoding classes

General Refactors
- Give Codecs to SequentialArranger instead of CodecFactory; ensures compatible element sizing

Palette
- Start adding unit tests
- Use lambdas/delegate for color converters

Project
- Isolate project retrieval from codec methods
- Transition to PathTree
- Implement renaming/moving logic
- Test schemas

Tests
- BitStream

Bugs
- ArrangerExtensions to move rows/pages assume each element's storage size is the same
